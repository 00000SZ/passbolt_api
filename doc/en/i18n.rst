Internationalization
####################

You will find here recommendations to internationalize your development.

Internationalize your code
==========================

In order to translate sentences either in PHP or in Javascript use the global function::

    __(str [, var1, var2 ...])

As in: ::

    __('Hello the %s world', 'mad')

%s : Variables' hook. Put as many as you want, but provide to the function as many 
variables as they are hooks in the string

Extract sentences to translate
==============================

CakePHP provides a console script to extract sentences from PHP code, it is now working 
either with PHP or Javascript codes. For now we create a shell script 
(**/passbolt_path/app/Console/build_po.sh**) based on the CakePHP Extract Task to extract 
front-end sentences to translate. This script will generate the template po file 
/passbolt_path/app/Console/jsDictionnary.pot.
